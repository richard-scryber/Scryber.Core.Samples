# Scryber.Core.Samples

These are the system test and sample files for the [Scryber.Core](https://github.com/richard-scryber/scryber.core) PDF Library.

We use these to change that everything is working (for us at least).

Take a look there or at our documentation [here](https://scrybercore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to understand more.

Thanks for taking a look.
